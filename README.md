## 🕊️ OpenCopilot Overview

Copilots are becoming the new paradigm how to build successful LLM-based applications, as seen by [Github](https://github.com/features/copilot), [Shopify](https://www.shopify.com/magic), [Brex](https://www.brex.com/journal/press/brex-openai-ai-tools-for-finance-teams), [Hubspot](https://app.hubspot.com/chatspot/chat), etc Copilots. Yet, building a Copilot that goes beyond a Twitter demo is extremely complex as it's time-consuming, unreliable and feels like a massive undertaking. Moreover, existing solutions such as Microsoft Copilot Stack are closed-source. Building an LLM-app today feels like:

OpenCopilot solves this problem so building your own Copilot becomes intuitive, fast and reliable - all so **you can build your copilot in a single day**. For example, you can build Copilots such as:

**🛠️ Developer tooling Copilot**

* End-to-end example: [Ready Player Me Copilot](https://github.com/opencopilotdev/opencopilot/tree/main/examples/ready_player_me_copilot)
* Example: [Stripe Copilot](https://stripe.com/newsroom/news/stripe-and-openai)

**💾 SaaS Copilot**

* Example: [HubSpot ChatSpot](https://chatspot.ai/)

**💳 E-commerce Copilot**

* Example: [Shopify Copilot](https://www.shopify.com/magic)
  
See more [use cases in docs](https://docs.opencopilot.dev/welcome/overview#use-cases).



## 🔍 Stack Overview
OpenCopilot provides one coherent end-to-end stack which is purposely designed for building a variety of copilots. From LLM selection (OSS LLMs upcoming), knowledge base, monitoring, evaluation, etc - it covers all the needs to build a useful copilot.

![opencopilot_stack](https://github.com/opencopilotdev/opencopilot/assets/5147210/140ca313-cf8a-4635-913e-8dbb5e33e8d4)

See our docs on [Stack Overview](https://docs.opencopilot.dev/welcome/overview#stack-overview) to learn more about each part of the OpenCopilot stack.

## ⚡ Quickstart

As prerequisites, you need to have **Python 3.8+** and **pip** installed.

### 1. Install the OpenCopilot Python package

```bash
pip install opencopilot-ai
```

### 2. Create a new python file to set up a minimal Copilot
For example, `copilot.py`, where you add the code from below. Also, add your own `openai_api_key`, which you can get [from here](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys).

If you don't have access to `gpt-4`, change the variable to `gpt-3.5-turbo-16k`.

```python
from opencopilot import OpenCopilot

copilot = OpenCopilot(
    openai_api_key="your-openai-api-key",
    llm_model_name="gpt-4",
    prompt_file="my_prompt.txt"
    )

# Run the copilot
copilot()
```
See our docs on [Configuration](https://docs.opencopilot.dev/integrate/configuration) if you'd like to learn more about other configuration options.

### 3. Create a prompt template
In the same directory create a text file, for example `my_prompt.txt`, add the following:

```txt
Your are a Parrot Copilot. Your purpose is to repeat what the user says, but in a different wording.

=========
{context}
=========

{history}
User: {question}
Parrot Copilot answer in Markdown:
```

The template variables will be filled at runtime; see our docs on [Prompting](https://docs.opencopilot.dev/improve/prompting) if you'd like to learn more.

### 4. Run the Copilot

```bash
python copilot.py
```

Your minimal copilot is now running as an API service, at `localhost:3000` by default. To see the full API documentation, go to [interactive Swagger docs](http://localhost:3000/docs#/Chat/handle_conversation_v0_conversation__conversation_id__post).

### 5. Chat with the Copilot
You can quickly test out and chat with your copilot using the command-line interface by running:

```bash
opencopilot chat "Hello, who are you?"
```

## 📖 Customizing, improving, testing and deploying your Copilot

While setting up the minimal copilot is quick, easy and fun, adding knowledge base to your copilot unlocks a whole new experience. Read how to customize your Copilot from the [documentation](https://docs.opencopilot.dev/improve/customize-your-copilo), which covers:

* Customizing your copilot with prompting
* Adding knowledge base
* Automatic evaluation
* Debugging LLM generation, retrieval, etc.
* Read more about the core features and stack choices of OpenCopilot in [Overview](https://docs.opencopilot.dev/welcome/overview).

## Optional: front-end

If you'd like to set up an out of the box front-end for your Copilot, follow the instructions in the [opencopilotdev/opencopilot-frontend](https://github.com/opencopilotdev/opencopilot-frontend) repository.
